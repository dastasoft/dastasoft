### Hi, I'm Daniel ðŸ‘‹

I've been making websites, applications, games and learning the ins and outs of technology since I can remember. I love learning, teaching what I have learned and approaching projects from an agile vision and from the user's point of view maintaining the quality of the code following the best practices.

Currently, both professionally and personally, I keep myself busy with React.js, Node.js, React Native and cloud technology to offer high performance, scalable and innovative solutions.

I'm currently working as a Full Stack Developer, check out my full [profile](https://dastasoft.netlify.app/).
